# golang-basic-rest-api


This is a basic Web REST API that has been built with Golang and Gin framework.

Disclaimer:
I do not claim that this very basic REST API to be following best practices, industry standards and whatnot.
This is just a repo that I tried basic operations on Go and tried a few new things that come to mind along the way when learning.
